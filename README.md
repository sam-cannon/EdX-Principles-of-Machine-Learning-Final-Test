# EdX-Principles-of-Machine-Learning-Final-Test
Classification and Regression Problems Solved for EdX Principles of Machine Learning Final Test
So, I took the edX course, Principles of Machine Learning: Python Edition, and these were the problems on the final test. Since
I felt like there wasn't a ton of support for the class in the discussion boards (or in the videos for this problem, at least approaching
it as a pure noob) I decided to post my answers here that were more than enough to pass the test. While there isn't a ton of direction
in the notebooks, it follows most of what is learned in the class. I apologize for there not being more comments throughout the code. If
you want to touch base about anything here or ask me how I did something just let me know at fultoncannon#gmail.com. Hope you enjoy if you
ever find yourself here.

Best,

Sam
